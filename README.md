# Discord-Bot
I wanted to use Selenium in a project so I decided to create a discord bot that will allow me to spam my friends.

## Skills used
* Python
* Selenium
* Annoying my friends

## Practical uses
Having a bot that spams is annoying and shouldn't be done, but even if you tried Discord only lets you send so many messages so quickly. 
</br>
The only actual use this bot can do is send a message to someone every 5 seconds over a long period of time or a lot of messages quickly but in a very short amount of time

</br>
<strong> Don't use this to spam anyone unless given permission </strong>
